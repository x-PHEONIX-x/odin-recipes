    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles.
        It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed,
        it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>
    <p>There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a flank steak. In this recipe, the steak is grilled 
        — we love the bold, smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. 
        But you can also easily cook your flank steak in the oven or on the stove.
